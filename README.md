This repository ("plannershmanner") is where I (Joe Bailey) developed my first scheduling application using JavaScript for the University of Richmond boot camp that I am currently enrolled in. The goal for this homework was to become more familiar with JavaScript and jQuery by demonstrating the ability to create a scheduling application that focused on jQuery basics.

Installation

We live in an age where scheduling is an important part of every day. Without a schedule mapped out many people would struggle to accomplish everything that needs to be accomplished in a single day. This scheduling application makes life easier with a push of a button. Simply select the time and length for an event, and schedule your whole week in minutes!

Credits

I was the main creator of the main application and repository. For help when facing obstacles I leaned on my friend Blake, and my friend Chris. Blake is a programmer with 7+ years in the business, and Chris is a work friend who is a fantastic problem solver. I also used YouTube to find different videos on JavaScript, scheduling applications, jQuery and various troubleshooting tips. 

Functionality

The application allows the user to quickly schedule hour sections throughout their week. This allows appointments to be kept, deadlines to be met, and confusion avoided.
